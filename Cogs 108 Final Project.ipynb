    "Gun violence has become a very hot topic lately due to the mass shootings at schools, concerts, and even in our own neighborhoods. It has emboldened both sides of the political spectrum; driving many to the polls to vote their beliefs and demand changes to the system. Even though this issue is a very controversial topic, we can not deny how it has greatly polarized this nation and caused a great schism between conservatives and liberals, Democrats and Republicans. On that note, we wanted to tackle this trend and see how congressional districts have changed due to gun violence. There are many articles and research on the internet, due to it being a hot topic, but it is very divided and has not reached a final verdict. That is why we want to use data to guide us in a path that will triangulate us to the right conclusions and possibly see how a district will swing based on the increase or decrease of gun violence. "
